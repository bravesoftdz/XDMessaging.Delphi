# XDMessaging.Delphi for Delphi XE3-XE8/10 Seattle/10.2 Tokyo
ThisÂ project ported from XDMessaging.Net project
https://github.com/TheCodeKing/XDMessaging.Net

this version just ported WM_COPYDATA mode, I developed it by Rad Studio 10.2, and I found it can not compile under 10.1, so I added XSuperObject support, it can use under 10.1.

compile lower than 10.2, you should download XSuperObject from https://github.com/onryldz/x-superobject
